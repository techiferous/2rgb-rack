h2. 2RGB -- An Example Rack Application

h3. What It Is

It's yet another website that converts colors between hex and rgb formats.

h3. Why It Is

There are two reasons this exists:

# I wanted to publish a simple example Rack application that hopefully will help people
  who are learning about Rack.
# I disliked the usability of the existing hex to rgb calculator websites.
